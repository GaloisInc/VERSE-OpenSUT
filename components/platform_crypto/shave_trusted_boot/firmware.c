 * Perform attestation---checking that a system was booted from a
 * known state in the past---on a system that has been booted with
 * trusted boot. A provisioned key is used to check the attestation
 * and a nonce is provided as part of the attestation protocol. They
 * key is typically provisioned into a specially protected store or is
 * automatically generated by the hardware during fabrication and
 * first initialization. The nonce is typically provided interactively
 * by attestation hardware or a remote protocol.
 *
 * This function only exists if `WITH_ATTEST` is enabled, and can be
 * called after a call to `reset()` has been successfully called, and
 * thus the system's initial state has been measured and the trusted
 * boot process has saved that validated measure in `last_measure`.
 *
 * If `hmac` is non-NULL, perform an HMAC-SHA256 on the catenation of
 * `last_measure` and `nonce` using an externally provisioned and
 * protected `key`.  If `measure` is non-NULL write that HMAC value to
 * `measure`.
